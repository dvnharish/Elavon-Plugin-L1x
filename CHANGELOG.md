  - üîç **No Configuration Required**: Works out-of-the-box for quick discovery
  
- **Improved Scan Type Names**
  - üîç **Regex Scan** - Find Converge endpoints, URLs, and DTOs (Default)
  - üèóÔ∏è **Scan Converge Business Logic** - Analyze where API calls happen, find service classes and endpoint configurations
  - üìã **DTO Scan** - Specifically find Data Transfer Objects and models
  
- **Enhanced Business Logic Detection**
