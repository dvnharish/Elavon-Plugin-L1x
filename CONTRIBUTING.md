Thank you for your interest in contributing to the L1X ElavonX Migrator! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dvnharish/Elavon-Plugin-L1x/issues) page
- Search existing issues before creating a new one
- Provide detailed information including:
  - VS Code version
  - Extension version
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Features
- Open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/dvnharish/Elavon-Plugin-L1x/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
- Describe the use case and benefits
- Consider the phase-based development approach

### Code Contributions

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.x or higher
- VS Code 1.74.0 or higher
- Git knowledge
- TypeScript experience

#### Development Setup
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Elavon-Plugin-L1x.git
cd Elavon-Plugin-L1x

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
npm test

# Start development
npm run watch
```

#### Development Workflow
1. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Make changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Run tests**: `npm test`
5. **Run linting**: `npm run lint`
6. **Commit changes**: Use conventional commit format
7. **Push and create PR**

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use proper type annotations

### Code Style
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use 2-space indentation
- Add trailing commas in multiline structures
- Use single quotes for strings

### Testing Requirements
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for panel interactions
- Use descriptive test names

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(scan): add regex pattern for Java Spring annotations`
- `fix(credentials): resolve SecretStorage race condition`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Panel Development
- Use TreeDataProvider pattern for consistency
- Implement proper refresh mechanisms
- Add appropriate context menu items
- Include toolbar buttons with icons

### Command Implementation
- Register commands in CommandRegistry
- Use proper logging with Logger utility
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide user feedback

### Testing Patterns
- Mock VS Code APIs using test utilities
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test descriptions
- Group related tests in describe blocks

## üìã Phase-Based Development

### Current Phase: Phase 1 ‚úÖ
- Professional UI with tree-based panels
- Interactive toolbar buttons
- Mock data and skeleton functionality

### Upcoming Phases
- **Phase 2**: Real code scanning with AST parsing
- **Phase 3**: Credential management with API integration
- **Phase 4**: OpenAPI specification processing
- **Phase 5**: AI-powered code generation

### Contributing to Future Phases
- Check the [tasks.md](.kiro/specs/l1x-elavonx-migrator/tasks.md) for specific tasks
- Focus on one phase at a time
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Update tests and documentation

## üîç Code Review Process

### What We Look For
- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Tests**: Are there adequate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is it properly documented?
- **Performance**: Does it impact extension startup time?
- **Security**: Are credentials handled securely?
