### Method 2: Install via Command Line

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the VSIX file
cd D:\personal-projects

# Install the extension
code --install-extension l1x-elavonx-migrator-0.4.1.vsix
```

### Method 3: Install via VS Code Command Palette

1. **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. **Type**: `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`
3. **Select the command** and choose the VSIX file

## 🔍 Verify Installation

After installation, you should see:

1. **L1X Icon** in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
2. **Four Panels** when you click the L1X icon:
   - 📊 Project Scan
   - 🔐 Credentials  
   - 📚 Documentation
   - 🔄 Migration

## 🧪 Test the New Context Menu Feature

### Step 1: Scan Your Project
1. Click the **L1X icon** in the Activity Bar
2. In the **Project Scan** panel, click the **🔍 Scan Project** button
3. Wait for the scan to complete

### Step 2: Test File Standard Detection
1. **Right-click** on any file in the scan results
2. You should see the new context menu with 5 options:
   - ✅ **Detect File Standard (Auto-Check)** ← This one is fully functional!
   - 🔄 Migrate to Elavon (coming soon)
   - 💬 Ask GitHub Copilot for Migration (coming soon)
   - 📂 Compare Converge and Elavon Specs (coming soon)
   - 🧪 Validate Elavon Compliance (coming soon)

### Step 3: Try File Standard Detection
1. Click **"✅ Detect File Standard (Auto-Check)"**
2. Watch for:
   - Progress notification during detection
   - Success notification with detected standard and confidence
   - File icon color change based on detected standard:
     - 🔴 **Red** = Converge standard
     - 🟢 **Green** = Elavon L1 standard
     - 🟡 **Yellow** = Mixed standards
     - ⚪ **Default** = Unknown standard

### Step 4: Test with Sample Files
The extension includes test files you can use:
- `test-files/sample-converge-file.js` - Should detect as Converge
- `test-files/sample-elavon-file.js` - Should detect as Elavon L1
- `test-files/sample-mixed-file.js` - Should detect as Mixed

## 🎯 What's Working Now

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- **File Standard Detection**: Automatically detects Converge vs Elavon L1 standards
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded file icons based on detected standard
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows confidence percentage in notifications
- **Caching System**: Fast repeated detections with intelligent cache invalidation
- **Batch Processing**: "Detect Standards for All Files" option
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### 🚧 Coming Soon (Placeholders)
- **Migration to Elavon**: Automated code migration using GitHub Copilot
- **Copilot Integration**: Custom prompts for migration assistance
- **Spec Comparison**: Side-by-side OpenAPI specification comparison
- **Compliance Validation**: Comprehensive Elavon L1 compliance checking

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing
- Ensure VS Code version is 1.74.0 or higher
- Try reloading VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
- Check VS Code's Output panel for any error messages

### Context Menu Not Showing
- Make sure you've run a scan first (scan results must exist)
- Right-click specifically on **file nodes** in the scan tree (not endpoint or summary nodes)
- Ensure the extension is activated (L1X icon should be visible)

### Detection Not Working
- Verify the file contains recognizable Converge or Elavon patterns
- Check the file is in a supported language (JS, TS, Java, C#, Python, PHP, Ruby, VB)
- Look for error notifications or check VS Code's Developer Console

## 📊 Performance Expectations

- **Detection Speed**: < 2 seconds for typical files
- **Batch Processing**: Processes 5 files concurrently
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with intelligent caching
- **Cache Duration**: Results cached for 1 hour or until file modification

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the VS Code **Output** panel (select "L1X ElavonX Migrator" from dropdown)
2. Open VS Code **Developer Console**: `Help` → `Toggle Developer Tools`
3. Look for `[L1X]` prefixed log messages
4. Try the troubleshooting steps above

## 🎉 Success!

Once installed and working, you'll have a powerful tool for:
- Identifying Converge API usage in your codebase
- Understanding which files need migration
- Preparing for the upcoming automated migration features

The foundation is now complete for implementing the remaining 4 context menu options in future updates!
