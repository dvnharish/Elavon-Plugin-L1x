# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The L1X Migrator extension needs a comprehensive OpenAPI specification comparison feature that allows developers to visually compare Converge and Elavon L1 API specifications. This feature will help developers understand the differences between the two APIs and identify the specific changes needed for migration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: OpenAPI Spec Loading and Parsing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically load and parse both Converge and Elavon L1 OpenAPI specifications, so that I can compare them side-by-side.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the comparison feature is triggered THEN the system SHALL load both OpenAPI specifications from the configured paths
2. WHEN loading specifications THEN the system SHALL validate the OpenAPI format and show errors for invalid specs
3. WHEN specs are loaded THEN the system SHALL cache them for performance
4. WHEN specs are updated THEN the system SHALL detect changes and reload automatically
5. WHEN specs fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2: Split-Pane Comparison Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see both API specifications in a split-pane interface with synchronized scrolling, so that I can easily compare corresponding sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the comparison view THEN the system SHALL display Converge spec on the left and Elavon L1 spec on the right
2. WHEN scrolling in one pane THEN the system SHALL synchronize scrolling in the other pane
3. WHEN the interface is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain proportional pane sizes
4. WHEN viewing large specs THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling for performance
5. WHEN sections are collapsed/expanded THEN the system SHALL maintain synchronization between panes#
## Requirement 3: Visual Diff Highlighting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see visual differences between the two specifications highlighted with colors, so that I can quickly identify what has changed between Converge and Elavon L1 APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing specs THEN the system SHALL highlight added sections in green
2. WHEN comparing specs THEN the system SHALL highlight removed sections in red
3. WHEN comparing specs THEN the system SHALL highlight modified sections in yellow
4. WHEN hovering over differences THEN the system SHALL show detailed change information
5. WHEN differences are complex THEN the system SHALL provide expandable detail views

### Requirement 4: Field Mapping Visualization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see visual connections between related fields in both specifications, so that I can understand how data structures map between the two APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing endpoint details THEN the system SHALL show visual connectors between related fields
2. WHEN hovering over a field THEN the system SHALL highlight its corresponding field in the other spec
3. WHEN fields have different names THEN the system SHALL show the mapping relationship
4. WHEN fields have different types THEN the system SHALL indicate the type conversion needed
5. WHEN mappings are uncertain THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels

### Requirement 5: Context-Aware Section Highlighting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the comparison to automatically highlight sections relevant to my selected file, so that I can focus on the specific API changes that affect my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN triggered from a file context THEN the system SHALL highlight relevant spec sections based on detected endpoints
2. WHEN no relevant sections are found THEN the system SHALL show the full specification with a notice
3. WHEN multiple endpoints are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight all relevant sections
4. WHEN relevance changes THEN the system SHALL update highlighting dynamically
5. WHEN user wants to see all sections THEN the system SHALL provide an option to show the complete specs
