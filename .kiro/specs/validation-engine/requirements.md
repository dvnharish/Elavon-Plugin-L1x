# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The L1X Migrator extension needs a comprehensive validation engine that can validate Elavon L1 API compliance for migrated code. This feature will help developers ensure their code follows Elavon L1 best practices, uses correct API patterns, and handles errors appropriately.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Layer Validation System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to validate my code against Elavon L1 API standards using multiple validation layers, so that I can ensure my migration is complete and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating a file THEN the system SHALL perform schema compliance validation against Elavon OpenAPI specs
2. WHEN validating code THEN the system SHALL check semantic patterns and best practices
3. WHEN validating syntax THEN the system SHALL integrate with language-specific linters
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive compliance score
5. WHEN violations are found THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and type

### Requirement 2: Automated Fix Suggestions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide automated fix suggestions for validation violations, so that I can quickly resolve compliance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN violations are detected THEN the system SHALL generate fix suggestions where possible
2. WHEN fixes are available THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels for automated fixes
3. WHEN manual fixes are needed THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance
4. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL re-validate to confirm resolution
5. WHEN fixes are complex THEN the system SHALL provide code examples and documentation links
