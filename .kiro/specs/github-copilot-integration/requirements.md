# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The L1X Migrator VS Code extension currently shows a placeholder message "ðŸ’¬ GitHub Copilot integration feature coming soon!" when users right-click a file in the Scan Panel and select "Ask GitHub Copilot for Migration." This specific context menu option needs to be replaced with a fully functional GitHub Copilot integration that provides intelligent migration assistance from Converge API to Elavon L1 API. The integration must send file context with detected API patterns, handle user consent, redact sensitive information, and invoke GitHub Copilot Chat to provide migration guidance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Replace Placeholder with GitHub Copilot Chat Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using the L1X Migrator, I want to click "Ask GitHub Copilot for Migration" on a scanned file and get intelligent migration suggestions through GitHub Copilot Chat, so that I can efficiently convert my Converge API code to Elavon L1 API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks a file in the Scan Panel and selects "Ask GitHub Copilot for Migration" THEN the system SHALL replace the current placeholder message
2. WHEN the command is triggered THEN the system SHALL check if GitHub Copilot extension is available and authenticated
3. IF GitHub Copilot is not available THEN the system SHALL display an error message "GitHub Copilot is not available. Please install and authenticate the GitHub Copilot extension."
4. WHEN GitHub Copilot is available THEN the system SHALL invoke `github.copilot.chat.ask` API with migration-specific prompt
5. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions

### Requirement 2: File Context and Migration Prompt Building

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to analyze my selected file and build a comprehensive migration prompt for GitHub Copilot, so that the AI understands my code context and provides relevant Converge-to-Elavon migration guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is selected THEN the system SHALL read the file content and extract basic metadata (path, language, size)
2. WHEN the file has existing standard detection results THEN the system SHALL include detected Converge/Elavon patterns in the context
3. WHEN building the prompt THEN the system SHALL include file path, detected API patterns, and migration request
4. WHEN the file contains detected endpoints THEN the system SHALL include relevant OpenAPI spec excerpts for context
5. WHEN the file is too large (>100KB) THEN the system SHALL truncate content while preserving API-related sections
6. WHEN context building fails THEN the system SHALL proceed with basic file information and warn the user

### Requirement 3: User Consent and Data Privacy

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to see exactly what data will be sent to GitHub Copilot and have control over the sharing, so that I can make informed decisions about my code privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating Copilot integration THEN the system SHALL display a consent modal showing the data payload preview
2. WHEN showing consent dialog THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what data will be shared with GitHub Copilot
3. WHEN user declines consent THEN the system SHALL abort the operation and log the decision
4. WHEN user approves consent THEN the system SHALL remember the choice for the current session
5. WHEN displaying data preview THEN the system SHALL show redacted content to protect sensitive information
6. WHEN consent is required THEN the system SHALL provide options to customize what data is included

### Requirement 4: Sensitive Data Redaction

**User Story:** As a developer working with production code, I want the system to automatically redact sensitive information before sending to GitHub Copilot, so that I don't accidentally expose credentials or proprietary data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing file content THEN the system SHALL identify and redact API keys, tokens, and passwords
2. WHEN detecting credentials THEN the system SHALL redact merchant IDs, secret keys, and authentication tokens
3. WHEN redacting data THEN the system SHALL replace sensitive values with placeholder text like `[REDACTED_API_KEY]`
4. WHEN redaction is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report of what was redacted
5. WHEN redaction fails to detect sensitive data THEN the system SHALL err on the side of caution and warn the user
6. WHEN user reviews redacted content THEN the system SHALL allow manual override for false positives

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Prompt Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to create well-structured prompts that provide GitHub Copilot with all necessary context for accurate migration suggestions, so that I receive high-quality, actionable code recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating prompts THEN the system SHALL use a structured template that includes file context, detected patterns, and migration goals
2. WHEN including OpenAPI specs THEN the system SHALL extract only relevant sections based on detected endpoints
3. WHEN building prompts THEN the system SHALL include clear instructions for Converge to Elavon L1 migration
4. WHEN prompts exceed length limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently truncate while preserving critical information
5. WHEN user wants customization THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to add custom instructions
6. WHEN generating prompts THEN the system SHALL include examples of expected output format

### Requirement 6: GitHub Copilot Chat Response Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see GitHub Copilot's migration response in the Copilot Chat interface and optionally view code suggestions in a diff format, so that I can understand the migration recommendations and apply them as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Copilot responds THEN the system SHALL open the Copilot Chat panel showing the conversation
2. WHEN the response contains code suggestions THEN the system SHALL offer to show a diff comparison
3. WHEN user chooses to view diff THEN the system SHALL open a side-by-side comparison with original vs suggested code
4. WHEN showing diffs THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's built-in diff viewer with syntax highlighting
5. WHEN no code suggestions are provided THEN the system SHALL show only the Copilot Chat response
6. WHEN the response is received THEN the system SHALL log the interaction for telemetry purposes

### Requirement 7: OpenAPI Specification Integration

**User Story:** As a developer migrating between API standards, I want the system to leverage both Converge and Elavon OpenAPI specifications to provide accurate endpoint mappings and field transformations, so that my migration follows the correct API patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading specifications THEN the system SHALL cache both Converge and Elavon OpenAPI specs for performance
2. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify relevant spec sections based on detected endpoints
3. WHEN building context THEN the system SHALL include endpoint mappings between Converge and Elavon APIs
4. WHEN specs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality with appropriate warnings
5. WHEN spec parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with available information
6. WHEN specs are updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate cache and reload specifications

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback when things go wrong, so that I can understand issues and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Copilot API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
2. WHEN file analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and partial functionality
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN unexpected errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN operations timeout THEN the system SHALL cancel gracefully and inform the user
6. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative actions or retry options

### Requirement 9: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the "Ask GitHub Copilot for Migration" feature to be fast and responsive, so that it doesn't interrupt my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking the context menu option THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds to show progress or results
